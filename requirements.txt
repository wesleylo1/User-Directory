# Requirements
# Your project shouldâ€¦

# Use at least 3 different components, including at least 1 that holds and updates state.

# Allow users to navigate through all the user information from the array in data.js using the < Previous and Next > buttons. Include special handling for those buttons for the first and last users in the array to avoid errors.

# Display where in the array the current user is located (ex. 1/25)

# Match the layout and styling of the mockup as closely as possible.


# Going Further
# After the < Previous and Next > buttons are functional, start working on Delete.

# After the Delete button is functional, start working on New. This will require a form for users to input new information. Focus on the functionality more than the styling.

# After the New button is functional, start working on Edit. This will also require a form for users to input updated information. Focus on the functionality more than the styling.
